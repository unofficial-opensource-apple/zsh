.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The Zsh source distribution includes a number of items contributed by the
user community\&.  These are not inherently a part of the shell, and some
may not be available in every zsh installation\&.  The most significant of
these are documented here\&.  For documentation on other contributed items
such as shell functions, look for comments in the function source files\&.

.SS "Accessing On\-Line Help"
.PP
The key sequence \fBESC h\fP is normally bound by ZLE to execute the
\fBrun\-help\fP widget (see
\fIzshzle\fP(1))\&.  This invokes the \fBrun\-help\fP command with the command word from the
current input line as its argument\&.  By default, \fBrun\-help\fP is an alias
for the \fBman\fP command, so this often fails when the command word is a
shell builtin or a user\-defined function\&.  By redefining the \fBrun\-help\fP
alias, one can improve the on\-line help provided by the shell\&.
.PP
The \fBhelpfiles\fP utility, found in the \fBUtil\fP directory of the
distribution, is a Perl program that can be used to process the zsh manual
to produce a separate help file for each shell builtin and for many other
shell features as well\&.  The autoloadable \fBrun\-help\fP function, found in
\fBFunctions/Misc\fP, searches for these helpfiles and performs several
other tests to produce the most complete help possible for the command\&.
.PP
There may already be a directory of help files on your system; look in
\fB/usr/share/zsh\fP or \fB/usr/local/share/zsh\fP and subdirectories below
those, or ask your system administrator\&.
.PP
To create your own help files with \fBhelpfiles\fP, choose or create a
directory where the individual command help files will reside\&.  For
example, you might choose \fB~/zsh_help\fP\&.  If you unpacked the zsh
distribution in your home directory, you would use the commands:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBmkdir ~/zsh_help
cd ~/zsh_help
man zshall | colcrt \- | \e 
perl ~/zsh\-4\&.2\&.3/Util/helpfiles\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
Next, to use the \fBrun\-help\fP function, you need to add lines something
like the following to your \fB\&.zshrc\fP or equivalent startup file:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBunalias run\-help
autoload run\-help
HELPDIR=~/zsh_help\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
The \fBHELPDIR\fP parameter tells \fBrun\-help\fP where to look for the help
files\&.  If your system already has a help file directory installed, set
\fBHELPDIR\fP to the path of that directory instead\&.
.PP
Note that in order for `\fBautoload run\-help\fP' to work, the \fBrun\-help\fP
file must be in one of the directories named in your \fBfpath\fP array (see
\fIzshparam\fP(1))\&.  This should already be the case if you have a standard zsh
installation; if it is not, copy \fBFunctions/Misc/run\-help\fP to an
appropriate directory\&.
.PP
.SS "Recompiling Functions"
.PP
If you frequently edit your zsh functions, or periodically update your zsh
installation to track the latest developments, you may find that function
digests compiled with the \fBzcompile\fP builtin are frequently out of date
with respect to the function source files\&.  This is not usually a problem,
because zsh always looks for the newest file when loading a function, but
it may cause slower shell startup and function loading\&.  Also, if a digest
file is explicitly used as an element of \fBfpath\fP, zsh won't check whether
any of its source files has changed\&.
.PP
The \fBzrecompile\fP autoloadable function, found in \fBFunctions/Misc\fP, can
be used to keep function digests up to date\&.
.PP

.TP
.PD
\fBzrecompile\fP [ \fB\-qt\fP ] \fB\-p\fP \fIargs\fP [ \fB\-\fP\fB\-\fP \fIargs\fP \&.\&.\&. ]
This tries to find \fB*\&.zwc\fP files and automatically re\-compile them if at
least one of the original files is newer than the compiled file\&.  This
works only if the names stored in the compiled files are full paths or are
relative to the directory that contains the \fB\&.zwc\fP file\&.
.RS
.PP
In the first form, each \fIname\fP is the name of a compiled file or a
directory containing \fB*\&.zwc\fP files that should be checked\&.  If no
arguments are given, the directories and \fB*\&.zwc\fP files in \fBfpath\fP are
used\&.
.PP
When \fB\-t\fP is given, no compilation is performed, but a return status of
zero (true) is set if there are files that need to be re\-compiled and
non\-zero (false) otherwise\&.  The \fB\-q\fP option quiets the chatty output
that describes what \fBzrecompile\fP is doing\&.
.PP
Without the \fB\-t\fP option, the return status is zero if all files that
needed re\-compilation could be compiled and non\-zero if compilation for at
least one of the files failed\&.
.PP
If the \fB\-p\fP option is given, the \fIargs\fP are interpreted as one
or more sets of arguments for \fBzcompile\fP, separated by `\fB\-\fP\fB\-\fP'\&.
For example:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBzrecompile \-p \e 
           \-R ~/\&.zshrc \-\- \e 
           \-M ~/\&.zcompdump \-\- \e 
           ~/zsh/comp\&.zwc ~/zsh/Completion/*/_*\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
This compiles \fB~/\&.zshrc\fP into \fB~/\&.zshrc\&.zwc\fP if that doesn't exist or
if it is older than \fB~/\&.zshrc\fP\&. The compiled file will be marked for
reading instead of mapping\&. The same is done for \fB~/\&.zcompdump\fP and
\fB~/\&.zcompdump\&.zwc\fP, but this compiled file is marked for mapping\&. The
last line re\-creates the file \fB~/zsh/comp\&.zwc\fP if any of the files
matching the given pattern is newer than it\&.
.PP
Without the \fB\-p\fP option, \fBzrecompile\fP does not create function digests
that do not already exist, nor does it add new functions to the digest\&.
.RE
.RE
.PP
The following shell loop is an example of a method for creating function
digests for all functions in your \fBfpath\fP, assuming that you have write
permission to the directories:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBfor ((i=1; i <= $#fpath; ++i)); do
  dir=$fpath[i]
  zwc=${dir:t}\&.zwc
  if [[ $dir == (\&.|\&.\&.) || $dir == (\&.|\&.\&.)/* ]]; then
    continue
  fi
  files=($dir/*(N\-\&.))
  if [[ \-w $dir:h && \-n $files ]]; then
    files=(${${(M)files%/*/*}#/})
    if ( cd $dir:h &&
         zrecompile \-p \-U \-z $zwc $files ); then
      fpath[i]=$fpath[i]\&.zwc
    fi
  fi
done\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
The \fB\-U\fP and \fB\-z\fP options are appropriate for functions in the default
zsh installation \fBfpath\fP; you may need to use different options for your
personal function directories\&.
.PP
Once the digests have been created and your \fBfpath\fP modified to refer to
them, you can keep them up to date by running \fBzrecompile\fP with no
arguments\&.
.PP
.SS "Keyboard Definition"
.PP
The large number of possible combinations of keyboards, workstations,
terminals, emulators, and window systems makes it impossible for zsh to
have built\-in key bindings for every situation\&.  The \fBzkbd\fP utility,
found in Functions/Misc, can help you quickly create key bindings for your
configuration\&.
.PP
Run \fBzkbd\fP either as an autoloaded function, or as a shell script:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBzsh \-f ~/zsh\-4\&.2\&.3/Functions/Misc/zkbd\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
When you run \fBzkbd\fP, it first asks you to enter your terminal type; if
the default it offers is correct, just press return\&.  It then asks you to
press a number of different keys to determine characteristics of your
keyboard and terminal; \fBzkbd\fP warns you if it finds anything out of the
ordinary, such as a Delete key that sends neither \fB^H\fP nor \fB^?\fP\&.
.PP
The keystrokes read by \fBzkbd\fP are recorded as a definition for an
associative array named \fBkey\fP, written to a file in the subdirectory
\fB\&.zkbd\fP within either your \fBHOME\fP or \fBZDOTDIR\fP directory\&.  The name
of the file is composed from the \fBTERM\fP, \fBVENDOR\fP and \fBOSTYPE\fP
parameters, joined by hyphens\&.
.PP
You may read this file into your \fB\&.zshrc\fP or another startup file with
the "source" or "\&." commands, then reference the \fBkey\fP parameter in
bindkey commands, like this:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBsource ${ZDOTDIR:\-$HOME}/\&.zkbd/$TERM\-$VENDOR\-$OSTYPE
[[ \-n ${key[Left]} ]] && bindkey "${key[Left]}" backward\-char
[[ \-n ${key[Right]} ]] && bindkey "${key[Right]}" forward\-char
# etc\&.\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
Note that in order for `\fBautoload zkbd\fP' to work, the \fBzkdb\fP file must
be in one of the directories named in your \fBfpath\fP array (see
\fIzshparam\fP(1))\&.  This should already be the case if you have a standard zsh
installation; if it is not, copy \fBFunctions/Misc/zkbd\fP to an
appropriate directory\&.
.PP
.SS "Dumping Shell State"
.PP
Occasionally you may encounter what appears to be a bug in the shell,
particularly if you are using a beta version of zsh or a development
release\&.  Usually it is sufficient to send a description of the
problem to one of the zsh mailing lists (see
\fIzsh\fP(1)), but sometimes one of the zsh developers will need to recreate your
environment in order to track the problem down\&.
.PP
The script named \fBreporter\fP, found in the \fBUtil\fP directory of the
distribution, is provided for this purpose\&.  (It is also possible to
\fBautoload reporter\fP, but \fBreporter\fP is not installed in \fBfpath\fP
by default\&.)  This script outputs a detailed dump of the shell state,
in the form of another script that can be read with `\fBzsh \-f\fP' to
recreate that state\&.
.PP
To use \fBreporter\fP, read the script into your shell with the `\fB\&.\fP'
command and redirect the output into a file:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fB\&. ~/zsh\-4\&.2\&.3/Util/reporter > zsh\&.report\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
You should check the \fBzsh\&.report\fP file for any sensitive information
such as passwords and delete them by hand before sending the script to the
developers\&.  Also, as the output can be voluminous, it's best to wait for
the developers to ask for this information before sending it\&.
.PP
You can also use \fBreporter\fP to dump only a subset of the shell state\&.
This is sometimes useful for creating startup files for the first time\&.
Most of the output from reporter is far more detailed than usually is
necessary for a startup file, but the \fBaliases\fP, \fBoptions\fP, and
\fBzstyles\fP states may be useful because they include only changes from
the defaults\&.  The \fBbindings\fP state may be useful if you have created
any of your own keymaps, because \fBreporter\fP arranges to dump the keymap
creation commands as well as the bindings for every keymap\&.
.PP
As is usual with automated tools, if you create a startup file with
\fBreporter\fP, you should edit the results to remove unnecessary commands\&.
Note that if you're using the new completion system, you should \fInot\fP
dump the \fBfunctions\fP state to your startup files with \fBreporter\fP; use
the \fBcompdump\fP function instead (see
\fIzshcompsys\fP(1))\&.

With the exception of `\fBall\fP', every \fIstate\fP can be abbreviated by

.SH "PROMPT THEMES"

.SS "Installation"
.PP
You should make sure all the functions from the \fBFunctions/Prompts\fP
directory of the source distribution are available; they all begin with
the string `\fBprompt_\fP' except for the special function`\fBpromptinit\fP'\&.
You also need the `\fBcolors\fP' function from \fBFunctions/Misc\fP\&.  All of
these functions may already have been installed on your system; if not,
you will need to find them and copy them\&.  The directory should appear as
one of the elements of the \fBfpath\fP array (this should already be the
case if they were installed), and at least the function \fBpromptinit\fP
should be autoloaded; it will autoload the rest\&.  Finally, to initialize
the use of the system you need to call the \fBpromptinit\fP function\&.  The
following code in your \fB\&.zshrc\fP will arrange for this; assume the
functions are stored in the directory \fB~/myfns\fP:

\fBselect\-word\-style\fP, \fBmatch\-words\-by\-style\fP
The eight `\fB\-match\fP' functions are drop\-in replacements for the
builtin widgets without the suffix\&.  By default they behave in a similar
way\&.  However, by the use of styles and the function \fBselect\-word\-style\fP,
the way words are matched can be altered\&.
.RS
.PP
The simplest way of configuring the functions is to use
\fBselect\-word\-style\fP, which can either be called as a normal function with
the appropriate argument, or invoked as a user\-defined widget that will
prompt for the first character of the word style to be used\&.  The first
time it is invoked, the eight \fB\-match\fP functions will automatically
replace the builtin versions, so they do not need to be loaded explicitly\&.
.PP
The word styles available are as follows\&.  Only the first character
is examined\&.
.PP
.PD 0
.TP
.PD
\fBbash\fP
Word characters are alphanumeric characters only\&.
.TP
\fBnormal\fP
As in normal shell operation:  word characters are alphanumeric characters
plus any characters present in the string given by the parameter
\fB$WORDCHARS\fP\&.
.TP
\fBshell\fP
Words are complete shell command arguments, possibly including complete
quoted strings, or any tokens special to the shell\&.
.TP
\fBwhitespace\fP
Words are any set of characters delimited by whitespace\&.
.TP
\fBdefault\fP
Restore the default settings; this is usually the same as `\fBnormal\fP'\&.
.PP
More control can be obtained using the \fBzstyle\fP command, as described in
\fIzshmodules\fP(1)\&.  Each style is looked up in the
context \fB:zle:\fP\fIwidget\fP where \fIwidget\fP is the name of the
user\-defined widget, not the name of the function implementing it, so in
the case of the definitions supplied by \fBselect\-word\-style\fP the
appropriate contexts are \fB:zle:forward\-word\fP, and so on\&.  The function
\fBselect\-word\-style\fP itself always defines styles for the context
`\fB:zle:*\fP' which can be overridden by more specific (longer) patterns as
well as explicit contexts\&.
.PP
The style \fBword\-style\fP specifies the rules to use\&.  This may have the
following values\&.
.PP
.PD 0
.TP
.PD
\fBnormal\fP
Use the standard shell rules, i\&.e\&. alphanumerics and \fB$WORDCHARS\fP, unless
overridden by the styles \fBword\-chars\fP or \fBword\-class\fP\&.
.TP
\fBspecified\fP
Similar to \fBnormal\fP, but \fIonly\fP the specified characters, and not also
alphanumerics, are considered word characters\&.
.TP
\fBunspecified\fP
The negation of specified\&.  The given characters are those which will
\fInot\fP be considered part of a word\&.
.TP
\fBshell\fP
Words are obtained by using the syntactic rules for generating shell
command arguments\&.  In addition, special tokens which are never command
arguments such as `\fB()\fP' are also treated as words\&.
.TP
\fBwhitespace\fP
Words are whitespace\-delimited strings of characters\&.
.PP
The first three of those styles usually use \fB$WORDCHARS\fP, but the value
in the parameter can be overridden by the style \fBword\-chars\fP, which works
in exactly the same way as \fB$WORDCHARS\fP\&.  In addition, the style
\fBword\-class\fP uses character class syntax to group characters and takes
precedence over \fBword\-chars\fP if both are set\&.  The \fBword\-class\fP style
does not include the surrounding brackets of the character class; for
example, `\fB\-:[:alnum:]\fP' is a valid \fBword\-class\fP to include all
alphanumerics plus the characters `\fB\-\fP' and `\fB:\fP'\&.  Be careful
including `\fB]\fP', `\fB^\fP' and `\fB\-\fP' as these are special inside
character classes\&.
.PP
The final style is \fBskip\-chars\fP\&.  This is mostly useful for
\fBtranspose\-words\fP and similar functions\&.  If set, it gives a count of
characters starting at the cursor position which will not be considered
part of the word and are treated as space, regardless of what they actually
are\&.  For example, if
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBzstyle ':zle:transpose\-words' skip\-chars 1\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
has been set, and \fBtranspose\-words\-match\fP is called with the cursor on
the \fIX\fP of \fBfoo\fP\fIX\fP\fBbar\fP, where \fIX\fP can be any character, then
the resulting expression is \fBbar\fP\fIX\fP\fBfoo\fP\&.
.PP
Here are some examples of use of the styles, actually taken from the
simplified interface in \fBselect\-word\-style\fP:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBzstyle ':zle:*' word\-style standard
zstyle ':zle:*' word\-chars ''\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
Implements bash\-style word handling for all widgets, i\&.e\&. only
alphanumerics are word characters; equivalent to setting
the parameter \fBWORDCHARS\fP empty for the given context\&.
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBstyle ':zle:*kill*' word\-style space\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
Uses space\-delimited words for widgets with the word `kill' in the name\&.
Neither of the styles \fBword\-chars\fP nor \fBword\-class\fP is used in this case\&.
.PP
The word matching and all the handling of \fBzstyle\fP settings is actually
implemented by the function \fBmatch\-words\-by\-style\fP\&.  This can be used to
create new user\-defined widgets\&.  The calling function should set the local
parameter \fBcurcontext\fP to \fB:zle:\fP\fIwidget\fP, create the local
parameter \fBmatched_words\fP and call \fBmatch\-words\-by\-style\fP with no
arguments\&.  On return, \fBmatched_words\fP will be set to an array with the
elements: (1) the start of the line (2) the word before the cursor (3) any
non\-word characters between that word and the cursor (4) any non\-word
character at the cursor position plus any remaining non\-word characters
before the next word, including all characters specified by the
\fBskip\-chars\fP style, (5) the word at or following the cursor (6) any
non\-word characters following that word (7) the remainder of the line\&.  Any
of the elements may be an empty string; the calling function should test
for this to decide whether it can perform its function\&.

It is possible to pass options with arguments to \fBmatch\-words\-by\-style\fP

\fBdelete\-whole\-word\-match\fP
This is another function which works like the \fB\-match\fP functions
described immediately above, i\&.e\&. using styles to decide the word
boundaries\&.  However, it is not a replacement for any existing function\&.
.RS
.PP
The basic behaviour is to delete the word around the cursor\&.  There is no
numeric prefix handling; only the single word around the cursor is
considered\&.  If the widget contains the string \fBkill\fP, the removed text
will be placed in the cutbuffer for future yanking\&.  This can be obtained
by defining \fBkill\-whole\-word\-match\fP as follows:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBzle \-N kill\-whole\-word\-match delete\-whole\-word\-match\fP

and then binding the widget \fBkill\-whole\-word\-match\fP\&.
.RE
.TP
\fBcopy\-earlier\-word\fP
This widget works like a combination of \fBinsert\-last\-word\fP and
\fBcopy\-prev\-shell\-word\fP\&.  Repeated invocations of the widget retrieve
earlier words on the relevant history line\&.  With a numeric argument
\fIN\fP, insert the \fIN\fPth word from the history line; \fIN\fP may be
negative to count from the end of the line\&.
.RS
.PP
If \fBinsert\-last\-word\fP has been used to retrieve the last word on a
previous history line, repeated invocations will replace that word with
earlier words from the same line\&.
.PP
Otherwise, the widget applies to words on the line currently being edited\&.
The \fBwidget\fP style can be set to the name of another widget that should
be called to retrieve words\&.  This widget must accept the same three
arguments as \fBinsert\-last\-word\fP\&.
.RE
.TP
\fBcycle\-completion\-positions\fP
After inserting an unambiguous string into the command line, the new
function based completion system may know about multiple places in
this string where characters are missing or differ from at least one
of the possible matches\&.  It will then place the cursor on the
position it considers to be the most interesting one, i\&.e\&. the one
where one can disambiguate between as many matches as possible with as 
little typing as possible\&.
.RS
.PP

\fBnarrow\-to\-region\fP may be used as a widget or called as a function from a

the calling widget should call this function with the option \fB\-S\fP,
perform its own editing on the command line or pass control to the user

\fBpredict\-on\fP
This set of functions implements predictive typing using history search\&.
After \fBpredict\-on\fP, typing characters causes the editor to look backward
in the history for the first line beginning with what you have typed so
far\&.  After \fBpredict\-off\fP, editing returns to normal for the line found\&.
In fact, you often don't even need to use \fBpredict\-off\fP, because if the
line doesn't match something in the history, adding a key performs
standard completion, and then inserts itself if no completions were found\&.
However, editing in the middle of a line is liable to confuse prediction;
see the \fBtoggle\fP style below\&.
.RS
.PP
With the function based completion system (which is needed for this), you
should be able to type \fBTAB\fP at almost any point to advance the cursor
to the next ``interesting'' character position (usually the end of the
current word, but sometimes somewhere in the middle of the word)\&.  And of
course as soon as the entire line is what you want, you can accept with
return, without needing to move the cursor to the end first\&.

\fBread\-from\-minibuffer\fP
This is most useful when called as a function from inside a widget, but will
work correctly as a widget in its own right\&.  It prompts for a value
below the current command line; a value may be input using all of the
standard zle operations (and not merely the restricted set available
when executing, for example, \fBexecute\-named\-cmd\fP)\&.  The value is then
returned to the calling function in the parameter \fB$REPLY\fP and the
editing buffer restored to its previous state\&.  If the read was aborted
by a keyboard break (typically \fB^G\fP), the function returns status 1
and \fB$REPLY\fP is not set\&.
.RS
.PP
If one argument is supplied to the function it is taken as a prompt,
otherwise `\fB? \fP' is used\&.  If two arguments are supplied, they are the
prompt and the initial value of \fB$LBUFFER\fP, and if a third argument is
given it is the initial value of \fB$RBUFFER\fP\&.  This provides a default
value and starting cursor placement\&.  Upon return the entire buffer is the
value of \fB$REPLY\fP\&.
.PP
One option is available: `\fB\-k\fP \fInum\fP' specifies that \fInum\fP
characters are to be read instead of a whole line\&.  The line editor is not
invoked recursively in this case, so depending on the terminal settings
the input may not be visible, and only the input keys are placed in
\fB$REPLY\fP, not the entire buffer\&.  Note that unlike the \fBread\fP builtin
\fInum\fP must be given; there is no default\&.

The name is a slight misnomer, as in fact the shell's own minibuffer is
not used\&.  Hence it is still possible to call \fBexecuted\-named\-cmd\fP and
similar functions while reading a value\&.

\fBreplace\-string\fP, \fBreplace\-pattern\fP
The function \fBreplace\-string\fP implements two widgets\&.
If defined under the same name as the function, it prompts for two
strings; the first (source) string will be replaced by the second
everywhere it occurs in the line editing buffer\&.
.RS
.PP
If the widget name contains the word `\fBpattern\fP', for example by
defining the widget using the command `\fBzle \-N replace\-pattern
replace\-string\fP', then the replacement is done by pattern matching\&.  All
zsh extended globbing patterns can be used in the source string; note
that unlike filename generation the pattern does not need to match an
entire word, nor do glob qualifiers have any effect\&.  In addition, the
replacement string can contain parameter or command substitutions\&.
Furthermore, a `\fB&\fP' in the replacement string will be replaced with
the matched source string, and a backquoted digit `\fB\e\fP\fIN\fP' will be
replaced by the \fIN\fPth parenthesised expression matched\&.  The form
`\fB\e{\fP\fIN\fP\fB}\fP' may be used to protect the digit from following
digits\&.
.PP
For example, starting from the line:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBprint This line contains fan and fond\fP

and invoking \fBreplace\-pattern\fP with the source string `\fBf(?)n\fP' and

.PP
The range of the replacement string can be limited by using the

.TP
\fBcompleter\fP
The \fBincremental\-complete\-word\fP and \fBinsert\-and\-predict\fP widgets set
up their top\-level context name before calling completion\&.  This allows
one to define different sets of completer functions for normal completion
and for these widgets\&.  For example, to use completion, approximation and
correction for normal completion, completion and correction for
incremental completion and only completion for prediction one could use:
.RS

It is a good idea to restrict the completers used in prediction, because
they may be automatically invoked as you type\&.  The \fB_list\fP and
\fB_menu\fP completers should never be used with prediction\&.  The
\fB_approximate\fP, \fB_correct\fP, \fB_expand\fP, and \fB_match\fP completers may

.TP
\fBkey\fP
The cursor is left
after the \fIn\fPth occurrence of the character just inserted, where
\fIn\fP is the number of times that character appeared in the word

leaving the cursor after the character just typed even if the

This function initializes several associative arrays to map color names to

\fBcolors\fP more than once\&.
.RS

The eight base colors are: black, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan,
and white\&.  Each of these has codes for foreground and background\&.  In
addition there are eight intensity attributes: bold, faint, standout,
underline, blink, reverse, and conceal\&.  Finally, there are six codes used
to negate attributes: none (reset all attributes to the defaults), normal
(neither bold nor faint), no\-standout, no\-underline, no\-blink, and
no\-reverse\&.

This function works like GNU xargs, except that instead of reading lines
of arguments from the standard input, it takes them from the command line\&.
This is useful because zsh, especially with recursive glob operators,
often can construct a command line for a shell function that is longer
than can be accepted by an external command\&.
.RS
.PP
The \fIoption\fP list represents options of the \fBzargs\fP command itself,
which are the same as those of \fBxargs\fP\&.  The \fIinput\fP list is the
collection of strings (often file names) that become the arguments of the
\fBcommand\fP, analogous to the standard input of \fBxargs\fP\&.  Finally, the
\fIarg\fP list consists of those arguments (usually options) that are
passed to the \fIcommand\fP each time it runs\&.  The \fIarg\fP list precedes
the elements from the \fBinput\fP list in each run\&.  If no \fIcommand\fP is
provided, then no \fIarg\fP list may be provided, and in that event the
default command is `\fBprint\fP' with arguments `\fB\-r \-\fP\fB\-\fP'\&.
.PP
For example, to get a long \fBls\fP listing of all plain files in the
current directory or its subdirectories:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBautoload \-U zargs
zargs \-\- **/*(\&.) \-\- ls \-l\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
Note that `\fB\-\fP\fB\-\fP' is used both to mark the end of the \fIoption\fP
list and to mark the end of the \fIinput\fP list, so it must appear twice
whenever the \fIinput\fP list may be empty\&.  If there is guaranteed to be
at least one \fIinput\fP and the first \fIinput\fP does not begin with a
`\fB\-\fP', then the first `\fB\-\fP\fB\-\fP' may be omitted\&.
.PP
In the event that the string `\fB\-\fP\fB\-\fP' is or may be an \fIinput\fP, the
\fB\-e\fP option may be used to change the end\-of\-inputs marker\&.  Note that
this does \fInot\fP change the end\-of\-options marker\&.  For example, to use
`\fB\&.\&.\fP' as the marker:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBzargs \-e\&.\&. \-\- **/*(\&.) \&.\&. ls \-l\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
This is a good choice in that example because no plain file can be named
`\fB\&.\&.\fP', but the best end\-marker depends on the circumstances\&.

\fBzcalc\fP [ \fIexpression\fP \&.\&.\&. ]
A reasonably powerful calculator based on zsh's arithmetic evaluation
facility\&.  The syntax is similar to that of formulae in most programming
languages; see
the section `Arithmetic Evaluation' in \fIzshmisc\fP(1) for details\&.  The mathematical
library \fBzsh/mathfunc\fP will be loaded if it is available; see
the section `The zsh/mathfunc Module' in \fIzshmodules\fP(1)\&.  The mathematical functions
correspond to the raw system libraries, so trigonometric functions are
evaluated using radians, and so on\&.
.RS
.PP
Each line typed is evaluated as an expression\&.  The prompt shows a number,
which corresponds to a positional parameter where the result of that
calculation is stored\&.  For example, the result of the calculation on the
line preceded by `\fB4> \fP' is available as \fB$4\fP\&.  Full command line
editing, including the history of previous calculations, is available; the
history is saved in the file \fB~/\&.zcalc_history\fP\&.  To exit, enter a blank
line or type `\fBq\fP' on its own\&.
.PP
If arguments are given to \fBzcalc\fP on start up, they are used to prime the
first few positional parameters\&.  A visual indication of this is given when
the calculator starts\&.
.PP
The constants \fBPI\fP (3\&.14159\&.\&.\&.) and \fBE\fP (2\&.71828\&.\&.\&.) are provided\&.
Parameter assignment is possible, but note that all parameters will be put
into the global namespace\&.
.PP
An extra facility is provided for changing the default output base\&.  Use,
for example, `\fB[#16]\fP' to display hexadecimal output preceded by an
indication of the base, or `\fB[##16]\fP' just to display the raw number in
the given base\&.  Bases themselves are always specified in decimal\&.
`\fB[#]\fP' restores the normal output format\&.
.PP
The output base can be initialised by passing the option `\fB\-#\fP\fIbase\fP',
for example `\fBzcalc \-#16\fP' (the `\fB#\fP' may have to be quoted, depending
on the globbing options set)\&.
.PP
The prompt is configurable via the parameter \fBZCALCPROMPT\fP, which
undergoes standard prompt expansion\&.  The index of the current entry is
stored locally in the first element of the array \fBpsvar\fP, which can be
referred to in \fBZCALCPROMPT\fP as `\fB%1v\fP'\&.  The default prompt is
`\fB%1v> \fP'\&.

.RS
.PP
Only one \fIname\fP argument is allowed\&.
If the \fB\-f\fP option is given, the name is taken to be that of
a function; if the function is marked for autoloading, \fBzed\fP searches
for it in the \fBfpath\fP and loads it\&.  Note that functions edited this way
are installed into the current shell, but \fInot\fP written back to the
autoload file\&.
.PP
Without \fB\-f\fP, \fIname\fP is the path name of the file to edit, which need
not exist; it is created on write, if necessary\&.
.PP
While editing, the function sets the main keymap to \fBzed\fP and the
vi command keymap to \fBzed\-vicmd\fP\&.  These will be copied from the existing
\fBmain\fP and \fBvicmd\fP keymaps if they do not exist the first time \fBzed\fP
is run\&.  They can be used to provide special key bindings used only in zed\&.
.PP
If it creates the keymap, \fBzed\fP rebinds the return key to insert a line
break and `\fB^X^W\fP' to accept the edit in the \fBzed\fP keymap, and binds
`\fBZZ\fP' to accept the edit in the \fBzed\-vicmd\fP keymap\&.
.PP
The bindings alone can be installed by running `\fBzed \-b\fP'\&.  This is
suitable for putting into a startup file\&.  Note that, if rerun,
this will overwrite the existing \fBzed\fP and \fBzed\-vicmd\fP keymaps\&.
.PP
Completion is available, and styles may be set with the context prefix
`\fB:completion:zed\fP'\&.
.PP
A zle widget \fBzed\-set\-file\-name\fP is available\&.  This can be called by
name from within zed using `\fB\eex zed\-set\-file\-name\fP' (note, however, that
because of zed's rebindings you will have to type \fB^j\fP at the end instead
of the return key), or can be bound to a key in either of the \fBzed\fP or
\fBzed\-vicmd\fP keymaps after `\fBzed \-b\fP' has been run\&.  When the widget is
called, it prompts for a new name for the file being edited\&.  When zed
exits the file will be written under that name and the original file will
be left alone\&.  The widget has no effect with `\fBzed \-f\fP'\&.
.PP
While \fBzed\-set\-file\-name\fP is running, zed uses the keymap
\fBzed\-normal\-keymap\fP, which is linked from the main keymap in effect
at the time zed initialised its bindings\&.  (This is to make the return key
operate normally\&.)  The result is that if the main keymap has been changed,
the widget won't notice\&.  This is not a concern for most users\&.
